Is it even a good idea to start a tech blog in 2021 ? When I only started coding two and a half years ago ?

# Getting interested in content

When I switched career I started reading A LOT of technical articles after my bootcamp.
I first read Medium articles, well, mostly added them to my Pocket and never opened them. Thankfully I progressively discovered newsletters which curate selected articles, I discovered blogs and voices of people who really inspired me. To name a few:
- [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
- [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
- [Denise Yu](https://deniseyu.io/)
- [Vicki Boykis](https://vicki.substack.com/people/919000-vicki-boykis)
- [Monica Lent](https://monicalent.com/blog/)
- [Val Head](https://valhead.com/blog/)
- [Sam Dickie](https://www.samdickie.me/writing)
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)

These are people that I love reading content from and I watch out every time they drop something.

We're in the content area anyway, right ? With podcasts, newsletters... It looks like the current trend is to actively suscribe to people we want to follow, or even support them (with Patreon, Twitch).

# Starting to write

The thing is, I have a political science degree, so I spent most of my studies reading, writing about my readings and doing presentations of my readings.
But after my studies I never wrote on my own. Even if I worked in the music field, moved to Paris and went to a lot of concerts, exhibitions... I never even had the idea of writing about all that.

I wrote my first tech article one month into the quarantine. I have to admit now it may not have happened without all this time I got on my own (social isolation for the win, yeah !). I think what helped too is that there's almost always an interest for someone to write about a tech subject from their perspective. I also see that as an excuse to dig deep into a subject, so I never faced an impostor syndrom, because there's always a win for me.

# Having my own space

Nowadays there is a lot of tools for tech writers to blog: [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/). They provide a community and readers. But they also get really noisy and the FOMO situation can get bad: everyone seems to be doing something / succeeding at something. I see my blog as a space where I can write anything, at anytime, just for my own pleasure of writing (and doing research).

I knew I wanted to make my blog with a static generator, because it's so convenient to change themes, or even adopt a headless CMS if I want to, and I finally concede to not build it from scratch.

üôè Many thanks to [Zaratan](https://www.zaratan.fr/): I used his blog as a starter template !
